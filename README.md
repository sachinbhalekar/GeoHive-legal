### Privacy Policy for TrailTracker

**Last Updated: July 27, 2025**

Thank you for using TrailTracker ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use our application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. By using TrailTracker, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

#### **1. Information We Collect**

To provide and improve our services, we collect the following types of information:

*   **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address and any name you provide. This information is used for authentication, identification, and to allow other users to find you if you choose to be discoverable.
*   **Location Data:**
    *   **Real-Time GPS Data:** The core function of our app is to track your location. We collect your precise GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude), altitude, and timestamps while you are actively recording a personal track or participating in a group "Room."
    *   **Historical Location Data:** We store the paths of your completed tracks and your activity within Rooms to provide you with a detailed history of your adventures.
*   **Contacts and Social Information:** We collect information about the connections you make within the app, including your contact list, contact requests sent and received, and room invitations. This is used solely to enable the social features of the App.
*   **Device and Technical Information:** We may collect information about your device and network connection, such as your IP address, device type, operating system version, and network status (Wi-Fi or cellular). This information is used to optimize app performance, improve our service (e.g., by adjusting sync frequency), and diagnose technical issues.

#### **2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide Core Services:** To enable personal GPS tracking, display your track history, and facilitate real-time location sharing in private Rooms.
*   **To Manage Your Account:** To authenticate your access, manage your profile, and facilitate your connections with other users.
*   **To Synchronize Your Data:** To save your data locally for offline use and sync it with our secure cloud servers (Firebase) so you never lose your history and can access it from any device.
*   **To Improve Our App:** To understand how our users interact with the app, identify and fix bugs, and develop new features.

#### **3. How We Share Your Information**

We do not sell your personal data. We only share your information in the following limited circumstances:

*   **With Other Users:** When you join a "Room," your real-time location and display name are shared with other members of that Room. This is a core feature and only happens when you explicitly choose to join a Room. Your personal, non-Room tracks are private to you unless you choose to export and share them yourself.
*   **With Service Providers:** We use third-party services to operate our app, such as Google Firebase for authentication, cloud data storage (Firestore), and analytics. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies and are not permitted to use your data for any other purpose.
*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

#### **4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention**

*   **Security:** We are committed to protecting your data. We use industry-standard security measures, including Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules, to safeguard your information against unauthorized access or disclosure.
*   **Data Storage:** Your data is stored locally on your device in a secure database and is also synced and stored on Google's secure Firebase platform.
*   **Data Retention:**
    *   **Personal Tracks & Checkpoints:** This data is stored for as long as you maintain your account, or until you choose to delete specific tracks or your entire account.
    *   **Room History:** To optimize performance and manage storage costs, location data from group Rooms is automatically deleted from our servers after a set period (currently 72 hours). This data is transient and intended for real-time use.

#### **5. Your Rights and Choices**

You have control over your personal information and can exercise your rights at any time:

*   **Access and Deletion:** You can access your track history and contacts at any time within the app. You have the right to delete individual tracks, checkpoints, contacts, or your entire account. Deleting your account will permanently remove all your associated data from our servers.
*   **Location Services:** You can enable or disable location services for TrailTracker at any time through your device's settings. Please note that disabling location services will prevent the app's core tracking features from working.

#### **6. Children's Privacy**

TrailTracker is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.

#### **7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
